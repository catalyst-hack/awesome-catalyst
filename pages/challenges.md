# 🏅 Challenges

[go back](/)

We have in this room a diverse range of skill sets and we want each individual to hone in on their particular skills to help develop and showcase an idea for a game which will redefine STEM for the younger generation. We want you to choose a direction which leverages your skills to present your idea in the best way possible. Whatever direction you choose, there are a few things you should think about:

- Does your final product portray your technical skills in some way? (We expect a little coding guys!!)
- Have you thought about the game story/logic
- What are your ‘business’ strategies, future plans and marketing ideas?
- Is your game promoting STEM?

It’s quite impossible to have everything figured out in less than 48 hours but we’d like to see your initial take on these aspects - depending on your personal and collective skills as a team you’ll end up developing some of these aspects in more detail. Don’t worry that’s expected! Whatever you decide it needs to portray your game and it’s future.
