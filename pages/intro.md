# 😱 This is my first hackathon

[go back](/)

If this is your first hackathon, don't worry, be happy 😄!

## 🥇Steps to success

- 🔎Find a team
- 🤔 Come up with an idea (keep it simple!)
- ✂ Cut corners
- 🎭 Fake it till you make it
- 🙋‍♀️ Ask questions

Once you have a team you need to come up with an idea. Remember you only have 24 hours so make sure that whatever you want to build can be done in that time.

## 😐 I am totally stuck

If you don't know where to start, I recommend [The coding train's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) - it has loads of great examples of games, simulations and all kind of simple programs to serve as inspiration. They also have a [full introduction to p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPWkPOfnGsw&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) which is great for people that have never programmed before.

If that is not enough don't be shy and ask away!

## 🔖 Prioritise

Focus on what you want to achieve, but be realistic! Your progress is gonna shape what you want to deliver, so 'cutting corners' might be the winning element! Don't be afraid of rethinking your strategy or idea.

We want to see your creative side, not your perfectionist one, so... whatever works! What you present doesn't need to be perfect and it's totally fine if it only works on your laptop.

P.S. Coffee ☕️ and StackOverflow are gonna be your best friends for these 24 hours so make the most of them!
